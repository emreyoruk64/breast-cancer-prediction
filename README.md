# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a tumor is **benign or malignant** based on medical measurements. The dataset consists of **various medical features** used in breast cancer diagnosis.

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to facilitate breast cancer diagnosis using **machine learning techniques**. **Scikit-Learn** is used for data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
- **Scikit-Learn** – Modeling and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization (if graphs are included)

## 📊 Model Performance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.93 |
| **Precision** | 0.89 |
| **Recall** | 0.93 |
| **F1-Score** | 0.91 |
| **ROC-AUC Score** | 0.98 |

The model has **high accuracy**, and an **ROC-AUC score of 0.98** indicates excellent ability to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.

## 📥 How to Run?
1. **Install required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
